Welcome! This repository contains educational documentation for the StratoLab high-altitude balloon project. Contributions from students, teachers, mentors, and community members are encouraged.

## Quick Start

1. Read the [Git Workflow Guidelines](.prompts/git-workflow.md)
2. Review the [Documentation Standards](.prompts/documentation-standards.md)

## What Goes Here

- Lesson content and tutorials
- Hardware assembly guides
- Research documentation
- Materials lists and checklists
- Educational resources

## What Goes Elsewhere

- **Code**: Arduino, MicroPython, and ESP32 code lives in the separate telemetry code repository
- **Issues**: If you find a problem, open an issue before starting work so the team is aware

## Safety

This is not typical documentation. Errors in wiring diagrams, specifications, or procedures can have real-world consequences. If your changes touch anything hardware-related, include a `SAFETY:` note in your commit message. See the [Git Workflow Guidelines](.prompts/git-workflow.md) for details.

## Getting Help

- Ask your mentor or teacher
- Open an issue with your question
- Reference the [Documentation Standards](.prompts/documentation-standards.md) for formatting and structure guidance
